It provides a modern web UI, built on top of AngularJS & Bootstrap 3, as well as an open API for third party integration.\r\n\r\nFor the back-end part a MySQL database stores everything. With such common requirements (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), Paperwork will be able to run not only on dedicated servers, but also on small to mid-size NAS devices (Synology (R), QNAP (R), etc.).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (might not be up to date, please use the demo below!)\r\n\r\n![01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/01.png)\r\n![02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/02.png)\r\n![03](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/03.png)\r\n![04](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/04.png)\r\n![05](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/05.png)\r\n![06](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/06.png)\r\n![07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/07.png)\r\n\r\n## Demo (yes, there is one!)\r\n\r\nAt [demo.paperwork.rocks](http://demo.paperwork.rocks) you can actually see the current development status of Paperwork. Every night at 3am (CET) the database is being dropped and newly created, and the latest sources from GitHub are being deployed on the machine.\r\n\r\nFeel free to create/modify/delete accounts, notebooks and notes. This demo can be used for heavy playing without regrets. Just try not to take down that thing. :)\r\n\r\n## Initial installation (quick & dirty documented)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need to clone this project to your machine. After that, make sure that you have one of the latest PHP versions > 5.1 and an up-to-date \"composer\" installed. If you're not sure how composer works, please continue reading here: https://getcomposer.org/\r\n\r\nSecond, you need to switch to the command line: \"cd\" into the \"frontend\" directory of your local paperwork clone. There, run \"composer install\" and/or \"composer update\". This will install all the needed dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow, before you do anything else, please check the files within the frontend/app/config/ directory. Especially the database.php. If you'd like to use the default DB settings (MySQL/MariaDB), you'll just need to have the database server running on port 3306 and create a database named \"paperwork\". You could use this SQL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDROP DATABASE IF EXISTS paperwork; CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS paperwork DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, you need the \"paperwork\" user to have full access to this database:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON paperwork.* TO 'paperwork'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'paperwork' WITH GRANT OPTION; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these settings, you won't need to modify the database.php configuration file.\r\n\r\nAfter completing these steps, run the migration jobs, that fill the database:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp artisan migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf anything here should fail, it's most likely an authentication/connection issue, so check your database setup again.\r\n\r\nNow, for the last step, make sure that your webserver has the right to create/modify/delete files within the `frontend/app/storage/attachments/`, the `frontend/app/storage/cache/`, the `frontend/app/storage/logs/` and the `frontend/app/storage/sessions/` folders. Also, be sure to set the document root (docroot) of your webserver to the folder `frontend/public/`.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. From here on, you should be able to access your paperwork instance through the web.\r\n\r\n## Run using Docker\r\n\r\nBasically you just have to:\r\n\r\n    fig up\r\n\r\nTo run the migrations (once):\r\n\r\n    fig run web php artisan migrate --force\r\n\r\n## Upgrading\r\n\r\nUpgrading to the latest GIT version of Paperwork is fairly easy. Update your local repository running `git pull`, then `cd` into the `frontend/` directory and run `php artisan migrate`. In most cases this should work. If you're experiencing issues, you might need to clear the database completely and re-run the initial installation.\r\n\r\n## API documentation\r\n\r\nThe API documentation can be found at [docs.paperwork.apiary.io](http://docs.paperwork.apiary.io/) or built using the ``apiary.apib`` file from this repository. It's not yet complete and could change at any time!\r\n\r\n## Some last words\r\n\r\nThe current development status is far from being worth called \"version 1.0\". However, if I could get you interested in this project and you feel like contributing, don't hesitate to ping me by e-mail ([marius@paperwork.rocks](mailto:marius@paperwork.rocks)) or twitter ([@devilx](https://twitter.com/devilx)) so we can talk. :-)\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### Can I run Paperwork on a shared host environment, where I'm not able to set `frontend/public` as document root?\r\n\r\nBasically you can. This has nothing to do with Paperwork specifically, though. The foundation ontop of which Paperwork is built up (Laravel) needs to be reconfigured to support a shared host environment. [Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=laravel+4+shared+host) you can find more info about how to do so.\r\n\r\n### Are you planning to implement ... into Paperwork soon?\r\n\r\nMaybe. Check out more detailed information about the features we are currently working on [here](https://trello.com/paperwork).\r\n\r\n### I would like to join Paperwork development, what's the best way to do so?\r\n\r\nContribute. Simply fork the Paperwork repository here on GitHub, add you contributions and send us pull-requests. In addition, make sure to shoot us an e-mail at [paperwork-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:paperwork-dev@googlegroups.com) and inform us about your interest in joining the team. We will then make sure to give you the required access to our [Trello](https://trello.com/paperwork) as well.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38443799-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
