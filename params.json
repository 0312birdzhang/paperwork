{"name":"Paperwork","tagline":"Paperwork - OpenSource note-taking & archiving alternative to Evernote, Microsoft OneNote & Google Keep","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twostairs/paperwork.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twostairs/paperwork)\r\n\r\n![paperwork-logo](paperwork-logo.png)\r\n\r\nPaperwork aims to be an open-source, self-hosted alternative to services like Evernote (R), Microsoft OneNote (R) or Google Keep (R).\r\n\r\nPaperwork is written in PHP, utilising the beautiful Laravel 4 framework. It provides a modern web UI, built on top of AngularJS & Bootstrap 3, as well as an open API for third party integration.\r\n\r\nFor the back-end part a MySQL database stores everything. With such common requirements (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), Paperwork will be able to run not only on dedicated servers, but also on small to mid-size NAS devices (Synology (R), QNAP (R), etc.).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (might not be up to date, please use the demo below!)\r\n\r\n![01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/master/Screenshots/01.png)\r\n![02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/master/Screenshots/02.png)\r\n![03](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/master/Screenshots/03.png)\r\n![04](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/master/Screenshots/04.png)\r\n\r\n## Demo (yes, there is one!)\r\n\r\nAt [paperwork.twostairs.com](http://paperwork.twostairs.com/) you can actually see the current development status of Paperwork. Every night at 3am (CET) the database is being dropped and newly created, and the latest sources from GitHub are being deployed on the machine.\r\n\r\nFeel free to create/modify/delete accounts, notebooks and notes. This demo can be used for heavy playing without regrets. Just try not to take down that thing. :)\r\n\r\n## Some last words\r\n\r\nThe current development status is far from being worth called \"version 1.0\". However, if I could get you interested in this project and you feel like contributing, don't hesitate to ping me by e-mail (marius at twostairs dot com) or twitter (@devilx) so we can talk. :-)\r\n","google":"UA-38443799-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
