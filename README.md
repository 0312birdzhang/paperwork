Paperwork - OpenSource note-taking & archiving
==============================================

Paperwork aims to be an open-source, self-hosted alternative to services like Evernote (R), Microsoft OneNote (R) or Google Keep (R).

Paperwork is written in PHP, utilising the beautiful Laravel 4 framework. It provides a modern web UI, built on top of AngularJS & Bootstrap 3, as well as an open API for third party integration.

For the back-end part a MySQL database stores everything. With such common requirements (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), Paperwork will be able to run not only on dedicated servers, but also on small to mid-size NAS devices (Synology (R), QNAP (R), etc.).

## Demo (yes, there is one!)

At [paperwork.twostairs.com](http://paperwork.twostairs.com/) you can actually see the current development status of Paperwork. Every night at 3am (CET) the database is being dropped and newly created, and the latest sources from GitHub are being deployed on the machine.

## Some last words

The current development status is far from being worth called "version 1.0". However, if I could get you interested in this project and you feel like contributing, don't hesitate to ping me by e-mail (marius at twostairs dot com) or twitter (@devilx) so we can talk. :-)
